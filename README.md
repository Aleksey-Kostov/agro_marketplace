* 🌐 Publicly accessible and responsive front end

## 🚀 Deployment

This app is deployed to **Microsoft Azure App Service**, using:

* **PostgreSQL Flexible Server**
* **Azure Blob Storage** for media/static file hosting
* **Terraform** for infrastructure as code (IaC)
* **GitHub source deployment**

## 👷️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.12
* Django 5.1.3
* PostgreSQL
* Azure Blob Storage
* Gunicorn + Whitenoise (for WSGI and static handling)
* HTML, CSS (custom templates)

## 📌 Notes

This project was built from scratch to explore full-stack Django development with production-level deployment practices. The code and deployment are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Aleksey-Kostov/agro_marketplace).

    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Create a superuser for accessing the Django admin**

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7. **Run the development server**

    ```bash

<summary>Deployment to Azure</summary>

This project is deployed using **Terraform** to manage the infrastructure on Microsoft Azure.

### Steps:

1. **Provision Azure resources** (App Service, PostgreSQL, Azure Blob Storage):

    ```bash
    terraform init
    terraform apply

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with Azure Blob Storage, make sure the `AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING`, `AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME`, and container names are set correctly in the `.env` file.
- Ensure PostgreSQL credentials are correctly defined and accessible from the Django settings.
